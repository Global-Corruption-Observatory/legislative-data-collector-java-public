Ref. 1 Petter Löberg (S)
Madam Speaker! Yesterday was a day of celebration in the Riksdag. The opening of the National Assembly was marked in the usual way by beautiful flower arrangements, carvings, nyckelharps and not least a considerable amount of cold talk which here in Stockholm is called mingling.

Now the Riksdag's first debate begins, and it is no wonder that it concerns a report that the justice committee has put on the Riksdag's table. It is pure contemporary logic, one might say. During the late summer, the committee met several times to speed up the processes with various legislative proposals.

I request approval of the committee's proposal, but would like to remind you of the special opinion that we social democrats have in the report and which I intend to explain in a little more detail in my speech.

The fact that it is precisely a JuU case debate that opens the parliament is a natural consequence of the exceptional situation our society finds itself in. A decade ago, the biggest problem of the correctional service was that there was an excess of capacity in the institutions. They needed to "downsize" their operations and close prisons, and they could send staff for training because there were not enough prisoners. Let's face it, that's not quite where we are today.

The initiative for today's report on secret means of coercion was taken by a Social Democratic minister together with the Green Party. It is in line with the uncompromising attitude our party has towards the ruthlessness of the gangs - an attitude which resulted in historically large investments in terms of finances and allocations in all parts of the justice chain, not least the police. It also led to major changes on the criminal justice side - changes which, in total, contributed to thousands of criminals having to atone for their crimes. In this sense, these efforts have been successful.

But at the same time we must state that the efforts have not helped fully. We see how the shootings continue unabated, not infrequently with their own inherent logic and changed mode. Recently, for example, we have seen how the relatives of gang criminals have been made legitimate targets for murder and attempted murder in environments where one day's friend and companion the next day is one's worst enemy.

We have seen that society's efforts to counteract segregation and inequality have been far from sufficient. No, Madam Speaker, we still have a lot to do. But a reminder to all of us is that we must do this with the support of scientific evidence and the principles of the rule of law.

As the first to enter the debate, I shall briefly outline the proposals. This should really be the task of the government representatives, but out of old habit I take it on. It is about preventive measures of coercion being allowed to be used in significantly more contexts than today to prevent certain crimes of a serious nature. For example, during a preliminary investigation, one must be able to use secret means of coercion to investigate more than one crime, provided that the penalty value is above a certain level. The catalog of crimes is also expanded. Covert room tapping and covert camera surveillance should be able to be linked to a suspect rather than a specific location. This is a great improvement for the police, which I believe will work well.

A slightly more problematic issue, which has been chosen to proceed with, is that excess information that has come to light through covert coercive means should be able to be used for other purposes. However, there are some objections here. We see, like several reference bodies, that this type of legislation shifts the interfaces between the state's tools and powers and the individual's right to privacy. Changes to this interface must be made with great care and consideration. The principles of the rule of law must be protected.

Each change can be justified on its own, even in the context of this report. But the overall balance over time must also exist. This means that the changes and enacted laws of the past decades must be weighed together with today's proposals, which we will decide on this afternoon, and upcoming, announced proposals. This balance must exist.

Since the 1940s, the state's possibilities for covert means of coercion have expanded from mere wiretapping to today's powerfully enhanced tools and resources. The powers of covert coercion have increased dramatically, but so have other aspects of privacy. It is about camera surveillance in public spaces, dna tools and AI tools, the power of which we are only seeing the beginning of. The various imprints of our digital life provide extensive tools for law enforcement authorities to be able to monitor us.

I think that it is fundamentally good that these tools exist, but without a local, peaceful and continuous presence in areas with the greatest problems, the police will always be characterized by poor clearance rates and low legitimacy. It is not only through today's report that we solve this. The suggestions can be effective, but my enumeration of powerful tools is just an illustration to show that it is not so simple.

To build robust support systems around children with risk factors, to have a society that holds together, to give young people in underprivileged areas prospects and faith in the future and to invest in civil society and associational life - these are things that take a long time and are expensive, but of course it is the the basic prerequisite for change. This must be put in relation to the allure of producing another repressive proposal or further eroding privacy. We've all been there; we're all there, in a way. Herein lies the danger.

In the climate context, we talk about a so-called tipping point - when many interacting processes together have irreversible and draconian consequences. We may also already soon have to warn of a tipping point in terms of how powerful tools the state should have regarding personal integrity, when the fundamental principles of the rule of law can no longer be maintained. We see, for example, purely grotesque proposals on the way forward, such as the Whistleblowing Act. At the latest yesterday, one could get the impression from the Prime Minister here in the rostrum that all confidentiality rules would be removed, as if they had no function to fulfill before. Clearly they have had it.

Here, with sadness in my heart, I could quote the Civil Rights Defenders in their analysis of the Tidö Agreement: "The Tidö Agreement shows that the global trend of democratic dismantling has come to Sweden. We have worked for human rights globally for 40 years, and these experiences will now well suited when we have to focus more of our work on defending fundamental freedoms and rights at home." Note the important thing in this quote: You have to change the rules, and it is not towards China, Hungary or Iran that you change the rules. It is against our own country that the Civil Rights Defenders rule. It is undeniably food for thought for all of us here in the House.

Madam Speaker! In conclusion, I promise that we Social Democrats, together with the rest of the opposition, will do our best to follow up on these rules - powerful tools that we largely support. But they will make great demands on us to be vigilant and constantly balance the new proposals that are on the Riksdag's table.

Ref. 2 Gudrun Nordborg (V)
Madam Speaker! I request approval of the Left Party's reservation 1. This means that we, on the Left Party's side, request rejection of the government's bill and the committee's proposed decision.

I do so because I draw further consequences from what was presented here in the rostrum just now. I am also well aware that the majority situation now means that the proposal in question will be approved this afternoon, regardless of what I will say, how heavy my arguments are and how much support there is among the referral bodies that have expressed themselves here - among them many heavy referral bodies. But I will still present the objections of the Left Party and myself, convinced that at least someone must stand up for the principles of the rule of law here in the chamber. This is the only way I can actualize what democracy should be. And that is the only way I can respond to the trust of my constituents.

The ideological divides that are now growing in our society must become visible and clear. Within the left, we want to create a completely different society from the repressive one that is falling out now, and above all that the state is given too many tools and that civil society is allowed to find itself and bend.

The members and delegates of the Left Party look with concern at the developments that have taken place since the 00s and which have led to us getting closer and closer to a surveillance system which is very worrying. JO writes, for example, in his eight-page opinion with rather scathing and disturbing criticism: "It goes without saying, but still deserves to be pointed out, that the legislator must always take a holistic view of the issue being dealt with."

Stockholm University also writes overall that there is a significant risk of the system being expanded according to the principle and logic of the sloping plane, where each change in itself appears to be less significant in relation to the whole and is therefore seen as acceptable, while the principled counter-arguments lose strength in the corresponding Mon.

It's a dangerously slippery slope. The consequences for the social climate can also be considered, and one should do so. What does this mean for democracy in the long term? It is difficult to get an overview, but we can see that the trust between those who live in Sweden and the state apparatus is increasingly failing, and this is a very dangerous development. Taken as a whole, two decades of tightened laws - they apply, for example, to camera surveillance, covert means of coercion, signals intelligence, control of foreigners and measures aimed at preventing terrorism - appear ominous. And more is on the way.

There is also much that can be commented on regarding the concrete legislative proposals in the report. Many of the referral bodies disapprove the proposals in whole or in part. I agree with such criticism. This applies, among other things, to an imprecise basis, such as gang affiliation or organized crime, which is invoked and which becomes a very vague prop. The proposed penalty value valves can also be questioned. They partly clash with the EU legal requirement that covert means of coercion may only be used to investigate serious crime.

The government also proposes that secret room tapping and secret camera surveillance should be linked to homes and to people instead of to a place. This means that these secret instruments will be extended to circles of people outside of those who may be suspected of crimes. It may be enough to be in the vicinity of a person who may be involved in gang crime. The report also contains questions about excess information that can be questioned.

When it has to be assessed as a whole, it is the combinations that create strong concern as well as flaws in how we have analyzed legal certainty, a lack of proportionality and an unclear effectiveness. We do not know whether the reforms will lead forward.

I also want to make one more point about something that I think is a bit remarkable about the fast track legislation. There is a law on secret data reading that was introduced in April 2020. In connection with the introduction of the legislation, it was said that it should be evaluated. The evaluation has not yet been presented, but the date for the report is in December this fall. Why can't one wait to be able to assess the effectiveness of the reforms that have already been launched?

This is a sign of a very stressed government. I can understand that, because it is a serious criminal development. From the opposition, however, we have constantly pointed to alternative ways where more can be invested in civil society's resources and on preventive activities. In this way, we strengthen democracy instead of challenging the borders.

Ref. 3 Adam Marttinen (SD)
Madam Speaker! We are debating the government's bill Secret means of coercion - effective tools to prevent and investigate serious crimes . I do not think it is possible to do that without addressing the developments of the last week or for that matter the last time, the last years or the last decades in society, where serious organized crime has come to influence and take a greater place in the local communities , the past week of murders of innocents, shootings that frighten and silence nearby residents and murders that affect relatives and innocents, and there the sadness spreads, and the terror takes hold.

It is in this context that we are now debating a bill from the government that will give law enforcement agencies better tools to access the criminal individuals through secret wiretapping.

I watched a bit of the news yesterday, Madam Speaker, and listened to interviews with the residents of the area in Uppsala where there have been recent murders and shootings. They told the reporter that the police know who they are, and they asked: Why aren't the police doing something about this? Why can't the police stop the shootings? Why can't the police stop the murders? This is because one does not have sufficient control over the plans that the gang criminals sew together to murder and shoot each other and their relatives.

The police do not have sufficient powers and tools to have the control that the citizens demand, but now the new government is moving forward with the support of the Sweden Democrats. There is a majority in Sweden's Riksdag to give the police the tools that the police themselves have requested. There is a majority for this.

I note, Madam Speaker, that in the same report there are reservations from the Social Democrats. The Green Party, the Left Party and the Center Party, which want to reject the bill and prevent the police and prosecutors from getting these tools.

There are reservations from, among others, the Green Party about limiting the possibility of using covert means of coercion when it comes to excess information, and there are limitations in terms of how we should investigate and charge our authorities with control over the tools we now want to give law enforcement agencies .

On the other side of politics, there are objections, rejection requests and proposals for restrictions, but on the part of the government with the support of the Sweden Democrats, there is clear approval for giving the police these tools.

There is quite a big difference in Swedish politics, Madam Speaker, and I am pleased that we finally have a clear majority for a paradigm shift in criminal policy that allows the government to be effective and not have to rely on cooperating parties that have objections and requests for rejection when it comes to the tools that the police themselves demand.

This, Madam Speaker, is not a new debate for the Sweden Democrats. As early as ten years ago, the Sweden Democrats in Sweden's Riksdag proposed that covert means of coercion be increased in order to gain access to serious organized crime. At the time, the Sweden Democrats were the only ones in the chamber to hold that view. All other parties agreed that the legislation was well balanced and that no changes were needed to tackle organized crime.

The Sweden Democrats anticipated that in the areas that are segregated through integration policies, through multicultural agendas and through mass immigration policies, violence will escalate. Here we need from the whole of society to act against the policies that previous governments have pursued, not least when it comes to the tools of the police, prosecutors and law enforcement authorities to access the crime that otherwise risks escalating.

Now crime has escalated as a result of previous governments' failed policies. Now it is very, very late to come up with the necessary tools, but it is none the less important that we move from words to action and actually do something about the situation.

Madam Speaker, there is always a discussion about where the balance should lie between personal integrity and the law enforcement authorities' ability to effectively investigate crimes. The Sweden Democrats have long pointed out that the emphasis has been far too much on protecting the integrity of criminals. This applies not only to covert means of coercion, but also to the possibility of furlough for criminals who are incarcerated and the possibility of parole for gang criminals.

When it comes to the conditions of gang criminals in general in society, the left's emphasis has always been on protecting their integrity, while the Sweden Democrats have highlighted that there is a problem that causes the gang criminal environment to expand as a result of a lack of action from the government.

In this debate, I will demand the rejection of all reservations from the left and the opposition and demand approval of the bill in its entirety.

Ref. 4 Ulrika Liljeberg (C)
Madam Speaker! Sweden is in a new situation. It is a situation where we wake up every day, by and large, to new deeds. I would like to take this opportunity to express a big thank you and my strong support to the police, prosecutors and the rest of the judiciary and other actors for the work they do for us citizens every day.

It is a tough situation, because we are dealing with serious organized crime and gang crime. There are repeated shootings and explosions in many places in the country. We see trafficking in drugs, weapons and people. We see widespread theft and fraud. We see people in the line of fire who are directly affected by death and severe injuries. We see the grief of the relatives, and we see that people and local communities everywhere, but also Sweden as a country, are indirectly affected by insecurity, mistrust and a reduced trust in the legal society. All of these losses are devastating in their own way.

The government's bill on covert means of coercion to prevent and investigate serious crimes is therefore a welcome and unfortunately necessary effort. The center party agrees with the need for an expansion of the police and prosecutors' toolbox in the way that is proposed and realizes that it can really make a difference to both law enforcement and prosecution. This refers, for example, to the expanded crime catalogs - to be able to intercept a certain person instead of a place, that surplus information should be able to be used and that also preventive coercive measures should be able to be used in more cases than now under certain special conditions. But it is also welcome with improved opportunities for transparency and supervision for the individual - for the suspect.

The legislation that the government is now proposing is, as I said, necessary and largely well balanced. But it is in a case like this, which concerns legislation of particular importance for one of the biggest social problems of our time but which at the same time has a far-reaching impact on individual freedoms and rights, that it is of considerable importance that the legislation is really transparent and that the government is humble in the face of the difficulties and consequences that the legislation may entail.

We have heard here that several reference bodies, among others JO, JK, the Security and Privacy Protection Board, the Swedish Bar Association and the Faculty of Law at Uppsala University are calling for a holistic approach to the regulation of secret means of coercion. They believe that it is difficult to get an overview of the overall and long-term effects of the proposals. The Center for Justice also requests a more detailed analysis of the compatibility of the proposals with the European Court's practice in the field, especially with regard to the principle of proportionality.

The responsibility therefore rests heavily on the government and its cooperating parties that the authorities implement and follow up on this, to conscientiously and balanced weigh the repressive and the rule of law principles against each other in the daily work. This means that you must use the tools that you now have access to, but that they must not be used more or more thoroughly than is required for the purpose of the measure and also that the documentation of this is taken care of. It is important.

Then I come to my objections. It is therefore important that an evaluation of the legislation is carried out in order to investigate how interpretation and application relate to the principles that we have highlighted.

However, the Center Party believes that the proposal for evaluation and application within five years is too generous in relation to these aspects. We believe that an investigation should be appointed within two years from the entry into force.

The proposals also lead to increased costs for the police, prosecutors, customs, the Ecocrime Authority and the controlling authorities The Security and Privacy Protection Board, JO, JK and Sweden's Courts.

The government must therefore ensure that the authorities and employees have the right support, resources, tools and leadership to implement this and that there is funding for the new and expanded tasks to be carried out at these authorities.

The government must therefore already within a year evaluate and ensure that the authorities have the right resources, because if the controlling authorities cannot do this, there is a deficiency in the implementation.

Madam Speaker! Here in the chamber, we have just heard Member of Parliament Marttinen claim that the Center Party is against this. The Center Party stands behind these proposals. The additional suggestions that we had and for which we now reserve ourselves are therefore a matter of this needing to be evaluated more quickly and that more resources should be added. If it is to be against a proposal, the degree of misinterpretation has reached new heights.

I request approval for reservation 4 from the Center Party, which specifically refers to resources to be able to follow up on otherwise good legislation.

Ref. 5 Rasmus Ling (MP)
Madam Speaker! It has been just over four years since a woman with her baby in her arms was murdered near Ribersborgsstranden in Malmö. It was a sunny late summer morning, and many of the Malmö residents who were still on holiday enjoyed swimming and sunbathing on the beach. But a few hundred meters away, this brutal murder took place. And just a couple of weeks ago, it was announced that the investigation is closed because it is no longer coming.

There are now frequent shootings and murders in Sweden. I do not think that we who are here in the House remember all since then. But there are some that settle deeper than others when boundaries are crossed. This was such a border when it was not only a question of settlements between rival gangs, but where it was also relatives who became victims and had to take their lives.

Recently, the boundaries have been crossed even further, with parents of gang members being targeted and actively sought out.

After the assassination four years ago, the then S-MP government took the initiative for cross-block negotiations. And although it was not a cross-bloc settlement, the result was a 34-point program that has since been followed up and for the most part implemented.

Two of the elements that were included in the 34-point program in the first points were the possibility of covert data reading and increased use of covert means of coercion. So that is what we have to decide on in the chamber today.

Madam Speaker! What is in the bill about these increased powers to use coercive means for the police are far-reaching powers, and it is not something we do lightly. You will be able to do this much more than before. One example is that authorizations for secret room tapping and secret camera surveillance should be linked to a suspect rather than to a specific location, which means that many more people who are very far from a criminal lifestyle will be monitored. This will also happen in places where you don't expect it because the people naturally move around.

These are privacy aspects that we and others, I hope, have considered. But it is, Madam Speaker, a price that we are prepared to pay because we have a development in Sweden that must be broken. And that is why we give these powers to the authorities.

The possibility of using coercive means in this way can solve more crimes than today, and it is especially important to do so when it comes to people who know things but do not want or do not dare to testify and tell the police what they know and prosecutors. But this can also prevent crimes from actually happening. So it can save lives, and it can save the lives of people who have nothing to do with crime, criminal gangs or settlements.

The Green Party therefore says yes to most of this bill. We have an objection regarding how to use so-called surplus information. The change will be very big compared to how it looks today. And we mean that if the police become aware of much less serious crime through these coercive means when guarding a gang criminal - if, for example, you overhear a person walking in town and tell them that the person in question built out their balcony without a building permit, which they were not allowed to use coercive measures and camera surveillance for the police - should you not be allowed to proceed with this type of information without further ado if you received the information in this way.

This is something that is criticized, that is, that the use is not regulated. It has received criticism from referral bodies - for example from JO but also from others. Therefore, we think that it should be regulated, and I therefore request approval of reservation 2.

We also support reservation 3 that this is legislation that must be evaluated. It is about big changes. As I said, we see that they need to be done, but when such a large reassignment of powers is made to the most important authorities, you also have to follow up on the outcome.

I therefore request approval of reservations 2 and 3.

Ref. 6 Torsten Elofsson (KD)
Madam Speaker! I think there is reason to highlight the criteria that govern the legality of the covert means of coercion used by law enforcement agencies, so that those who may be listening to the debate have some sort of background.

The criteria actually consist of three principles. The first criterion is the expedient principle, which means that coercion may only be used if there is support in law. The second is the necessity principle, which means that coercive means may only be used if other means are insufficient. The third and last and final criterion is the principle of proportionality, which means that there must be a link between the severity of the offense and the force used. Simply put, we can say: The more serious the crime, the more coercion can be used.

The coercive measures we are debating today must be weighed against people's right to respect for private life, i.e. personal integrity, which previous speakers have touched on. It is undeniably the case that covert means of coercion in the form of telephone tapping, data reading, camera surveillance and room monitoring involve a considerable intrusion into people's privacy for the person who becomes the subject of such measures.

In order to ensure that the use of such coercive means meets the requirements of purpose, proportionality and need, the matter must be examined by a court in the presence of a legal representative. There is also supervision and parliamentary control to ensure legality and correct use. It is therefore not the police and customs who themselves decide when to use the secret means of coercion.

Madam Speaker! There must always be a trade-off between need and breach of privacy. The question is therefore whether there is a need for an expanded regulatory framework for covert means of coercion, and we Christian Democrats believe that this is the case.

As a former police officer with about 40 years of experience, I have seen how the conditions for police work have changed over the years. It was mentioned earlier that in the 40s it was telephone tapping that was relevant - well, there really wasn't much other technology to deal with. However, we can state that today we find ourselves in an increasingly digitized world where the personal meeting has largely been replaced by contacts in the form of digital meetings.

The criminal investigation that was previously largely carried out in the field thus now has major limitations. Contacts in gangs and organized crime have largely moved online and been replaced by encrypted chats and other technologies. Seen in the rearview mirror, it is largely thanks to the fact that foreign police managed to crack Encrochat and other encrypted chats that Swedish police have solved several serious crimes that would otherwise have remained unsolved.

Madam Speaker! We have seen a development where crimes have become increasingly sophisticated, systematic, gross and organized. As has also been mentioned by previous speakers, we currently have a very serious situation in terms of gang crime and organized crime, with serious violent crimes in the form of shootings and explosions which are actually largely unprecedented in the rest of Europe. The Minister of Justice has previously referred to it as a form of domestic terrorism, and we are probably prepared to agree with him in that regard.

While this is going on, we can see customs reporting record drug seizures, and we see an increase in cross-border crime. We see this at the same time as we have an elevated threat picture with an increased risk of attacks. Against this background, it is important that we strengthen our ability to prevent and deal with crime.

A high police presence in the local community and an efficient customs operation are important components, but if we are to really attack and fight the serious and organized crime and get to the main actors - those who are behind this - more sophisticated methods are required. Seen in that perspective and with that objective, there is thus a great need for the use of covert means of coercion. Traditional police activities in the field must be supplemented to a greater extent with competence, resources and technology in order to defeat the criminal networks.

Madam Speaker! The proposal also includes so-called penalty value valves in case of serial offences. This refers to crimes which individually may not have a high penalty value, but which receive an overall high penalty value if they occur systematically. In the report there is a list of crimes that may be relevant - examples of such crimes are fraud, and then perhaps crimes of aging, as well as certain sexual crimes - and where secret means of coercion can be used if the punishment is at least two years. For secret room tapping, a penalty of at least four years is required.

We think this is justified. When it comes to organized crime, it affects both children and the elderly, and it would be strange if we could not use this kind of coercive means to get at this kind of crime.

We also welcome the possibility of using so-called surplus information about other crimes to an increased extent. Current restrictions feel strange, to say the least, because crimes that come to the attention of the police must normally be reported and investigated. When it comes to information about crimes that come to the attention of the police through the secret wiretapping, however, an exception has been made, and it becomes very contradictory not to report it.

Using the information to fight or investigate crime is judged to have only marginal effects and increase the intrusion that the collection itself may have entailed. Against this must be set the positive effects that the proposals can be assumed to have. An expanded area of ​​use is not only important for the state's interest in fighting and investigating crime, but also for the victim's interest in receiving the redress that prosecution and the right to damages entail - as well as the importance for the crime victim that law enforcement authorities have good opportunities to interrupt crimes in progress. In that sense, it can also be stated that crime prevention activities are improved by being able to use covert means of coercion, because we can prevent crimes from being committed.

Madam Speaker! The proposal also means that secret surveillance must be able to take place in real time. There is a clear need to be able to retrieve information about messages in real time, as for example the work with Encrochat shows. This applies not least when it comes to accessing more complex cyber crimes. The corresponding possibility exists today in several other countries, and the lack of effective investigation possibilities in Sweden is a weakness that we believe should be remedied.

All in all, we believe on the part of the Christian Democrats that the proposals in the report are well motivated and mean a significantly increased opportunity for an effective crime-fighting of the more serious and systematic crime. We therefore demand approval of the bill and rejection of all reservations.

Ref. 7 Rasmus Ling (MP)
Madam Speaker! I would like to request approval for both reservation 2 and reservation 3.

When I still have the floor, I can also take the opportunity to ask a question.

Before the summer break, a debate was held here in the chamber in which me and Torsten Elofsson debated security guards. I thought the training period was too short and asked Elofsson about it. He replied that this is something that the police decide best themselves. According to Elofsson, a political decision from the Riksdag or government would be to discredit the police. The week after we debated this, the government made the decision I asked for. The content, Madam Speaker, was then that the government rejected the police, according to Torsten Elofsson.

Yesterday was the opening of the National Assembly. The party leader of Torsten Elofsson's Christian Democrats, Ebba Busch, said she wants to withdraw aid to Turkey if the Kurdish fox is not extradited to Sweden. This morning she took it back.

My question, Madam Speaker, is: How long is the half-life for a Christian Democratic message?

Ref. 8 Torsten Elofsson (KD)
Madam Speaker! I thank Rasmus Ling for the questions.

Regarding the first question, I referred to the regulation governing the training of security guards. It says, as I recall, that it should be at least 30 hours. According to the regulation, there is thus no obstacle to build on the education with additional hours. As far as I know, this regulation is still in force.

What my party leader Ebba Busch has said or not said, I actually do not know at all. I think that Rasmus Ling should ask that question to Ebba Busch personally.

Ref. 9 Rasmus Ling (MP)
Madam Speaker! I fully understand that it is not easy to know which line Ebba Busch has for the day, so I will not blame Torsten Elofsson for this. It was more of an observation - this is surely equally difficult for all of us to keep right.

Speaking of the first example of the public order law, a de facto government decision was made, and it was precisely this that Torsten Elofsson said was to disapprove of the police. Either he thinks the government did just that, or he changed his line less than a week after we had this debate.

My question was of a more general nature, and you can certainly go into more examples. Why don't Christian Democratic announcements apply for longer than one day or a maximum of one week?

Ref. 11 Torsten Elofsson (KD)
Madam Speaker! I can only agree - we're not really sticking to the topic today, for whatever reason.

I maintain that there is a regulation that regulates the training for security guards and that it is the one that still applies. I don't really know what Rasmus Ling is referring to with his statement. I content myself with stating this.

Ref. 12 Juno Blom (L)
Madam Speaker! Today we are debating covert means of coercion, which are necessary to address systemic crime that leaves victims with lifelong trauma, shatters families, and in some cases terrorizes entire neighborhoods.

Criminal gangs prey on children and cause children to commit serious crimes, leading to children even being executed. It is a painful reality and a reality that we politicians are obliged to act on.

It is clear that more tools are needed in the fight against serious organized crime. The judiciary must be given better conditions to be able to prevent and prevent the serious development of violence as well as to be able to prosecute those responsible for the crimes.

Expanded opportunities to use covert means of coercion are an important part of the preventive work. This is important so that the justice system can act before the serious crimes take place and important so that you can get the supporting evidence required to obtain convictions. Evidence of support is very difficult to obtain when there is a culture of silence in the criminal gangs.

Criminals have very much moved into the digital world. They communicate, plan and act much more digitally today. This applies to the highest degree to sex offenders who are looking for children to exploit and force to send nude pictures or commit sexual acts against their will.

The children who are subjected to sexual abuse are rarely heard of in the debate about secret means of coercion. A 17-year-old girl says this to Ecpat: I remember my first unwanted nude when I was ten. I got scared and nauseous and deleted the app but was soon back again. Since then it's probably happened once a month, but scary enough more when I was 11-15 than now when I'm 17.

We in this chamber have a responsibility to listen to the children. Someone who listens to the children - and the most vulnerable children - every day is the children's rights organization Ecpat. Ecpat asked questions to 1,435 children about their exposure to sexual abuse online. 88 percent of girls said they had been sent nude pictures, and 46 percent of girls between the ages of 10 and 13 had been offered money to send pictures.

I have met vulnerable children too many times. These are children who are exposed to, for example, sexual abuse. These are children that no one sees - young adults who are forced to live with the memories of abuse every day and who know that their abusers are going free.

Madam Speaker! Child pornography crime is a crime that these days is mainly committed via the internet. The same applies to sexual exploitation of children and sexual abuse of children, for example when the perpetrator forces the child to perform sexual acts via a webcam.

Today we have a report in front of us that closes important gaps in the legislation that both prosecutors and police as well as Ecpat have warned about. These are reforms that they have been asking for. I am extremely grateful for the work that the judiciary puts in. The important thing we can do from the legislator's side is to provide the right conditions.

There are far too many perpetrators who are not identified. There are far too many cases where the evidence against a suspected perpetrator is insufficient for a conviction and where the use of covert means of coercion could have secured evidence.

Sexual crimes against children constitute serious criminality as well as extensive violations of the child's privacy and right to personal integrity. Today, it is not unusual for the sexual abuse to be documented and spread to others. This leads to the violations being repeated again and again.

That is why the proposal on expanded criminal catalogs is extremely important. This means that covert interception of electronic communications, covert camera surveillance and covert data reading that do not apply to room interception data must be used in a preliminary investigation that deals with, among other things, gross sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children, sexual abuse of children, gross sexual abuse of children, exploitation of children for sexual posing, gross exploitation of children for sexual posing, exploitation of children through the purchase of sexual acts, sexual molestation of children, gross sexual molestation of children and contact to meet a child for sexual purposes. This applies if it can be assumed that the offense does not lead to only a fine.

Ecpat emphasizes in its consultation response that the evidence that can be obtained through covert means of coercion is often of decisive importance in preliminary investigations into sexual crimes against children committed online. It is also common that in connection with an investigation of a sexual crime against children, several other sexual crimes against children are discovered.

Madam Speaker! It is therefore important that law enforcement agencies have access to these covert means of coercion in this type of serious crime against children in order to be able to detect the abuse and to be able to stop crime in progress.

Personal integrity must be protected. We agree on that. All regulations on secret means of coercion must live up to the high legal certainty requirements that exist. This applies to both the rules themselves and their application. Any general restriction of the individual's right to respect for private life and protection of personal integrity must of course have good reasons and grounds.

Madam Speaker! When we talk about integrity, we must at the same time dare to weigh the integrity of different individuals against each other. Expanding the catalog of crimes to include sexual abuse of children is extremely important.

It is about the integrity of the little child, the girl and the boy who are constantly being abused. Their right to privacy must weigh heavily. Their vulnerability, lack of freedom and powerlessness must be before our eyes.

Today, there are far too many perpetrators who are not identified or where the evidence against a suspected perpetrator is not sufficient for a conviction. There, the use of covert means of coercion could have secured crucial evidence. Today we are changing that order. Today we take a stand for the vulnerable children. We should be proud of that.

Madam Speaker! The Liberals support the report in its entirety.

Ref. 13 Louise Meijer (M)
Madam Speaker! Every day, many people with foreign debt go to work here in Sweden. Many do the right thing for themselves. They set their alarm clock. They take their children to preschool, get in the car and go to work. It is often quite tiring work. They can work as a nurse, as a taxi driver or in other types of professions that require mental but also physical effort for many hours of the day. We also have many foreign debtors in our country who are now start-up millionaires. They run various tech companies that are on the international scene.

We have many people who have come to our country. They are either born abroad or born here and are second or third generation immigrants, and they are doing very, very good for our country. Sometimes we lose that perspective. In the wake of integration and migration, we have very big problems here in Sweden. But that perspective must always be supplemented. The Moderates will always be careful about that. It must always be supplemented by showing, understanding and knowing how important contributions a great many people with foreign debt make for our country.

Precisely for this reason, the policy that the government pursues together with the cooperating parties becomes very important. It is not infrequent that the victims of poor integration are the hard-working immigrants in marginalized areas. Most recently, we have an example from Rosengård where they burned cars and behaved like idiots, shall we say from this pulpit. Some of the cars that were burned belonged to a business owner who has struggled to keep the company going and who now has three burned cars and staff who are on sick leave.

There are also shops that are set on fire, looted and destroyed. They receive increased insurance costs because the risk of their business being exposed to crime is so high. Their marketing also goes haywire if there is a shooting outside or if suddenly there is a corpse outside the door. That's not really the case at the Ica store where I shop. There are no shootings there, but there are meat thefts.

Together with this, we have a development where the gang criminality now goes to relatives. It is, of course, a worrying development because it strikes fear into very large parts of our society. But we have also for a long time had a development where the gang criminals shoot the wrong person. Not infrequently, these are also people with foreign debt and a foreign background. I would especially like to mention Ahmed, who was shot at a bus stop in Malmö in 2017. It was the wrong person. He had nothing to do with gang crime. He came here a few years earlier from Iraq and was supposed to become a doctor. We can't have it like that.

This is why the Moderates, the government and the partner parties will time and again continue to put forward proposals to increase the effectiveness of the fight against crime. Today, it is about expanding the possibility of using covert means of coercion and preventive wiretapping.

The discussion was hereby concluded.
