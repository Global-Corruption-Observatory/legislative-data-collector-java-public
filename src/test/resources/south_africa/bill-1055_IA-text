PART ONE: ANALYSIS FOR FINAL SEIAS REPORT

Please keep your answers as short as possible. Do not copy directly from any other
document.
1. Conceptual Framework, Problem Statement, Aims and Theory of Change

1.1. What socio-economic problem does the proposal aim to resolve?

In April 2013, the Minister of Basic Education, having identified the review of all
basic education legislation as a strategic priority for the Department of Basic
Education (DBE), appointed the Basic Education Laws Review Task Team to
review the basic education legislation. The Task Team consisted of DBE officials
and legal representatives of four of the provincial education departments (PEDs)
(the Western Cape, Gauteng, the Free State, and KwaZulu-Natal). The terms of
reference (attached) for the Task Team was to look into the existing provision of
the SASA and the EEA and review the two Act in line with developments in the
education landscape

One of the developments in the education landscape came about in 2009, when
the then Department of Education was split into two new departments – those of
Basic Education and of Higher Education and Training. (Proclamation No. 44 of
2009, signed by the President on 20 June 2009 and published in Government
Gazette No. 32367 on 1 July 2009.)

The BELA Bill intends to ensure that systems of learning and excellence in
education are put in place in a manner which respects, protects, promotes and
fulfils the right to basic education enshrined in section 29(1) of the Constitution
of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. The BELA Bill seeks to amend the SASA
and the EEA so as to make certain technical and substantive adjustments, to
clarify certain existing provisions and to insert certain provisions to cover matters
which are not provided for in the existing legislation.
The socio-economic problems that led to the proposed amendments are as
follows:
 Challenges in regard to learners’ school performance and access to quality
basic education.

The Bill seeks to amend section 3(1) of the SASA to provide that school
attendance is compulsory from grade R and no longer only from grade 1; and
to increase the penalty provision in section 3(6) of the SASA from six months
to 12 months in the case where the parent of a learner, without just cause, fails
to ensure that a learner who is subject to compulsory school attendance attends
school, or where any other person, without just cause, prevents such a learner
from attending school. The clause also creates an offence in the case where
any person unlawfully and intentionally interrupts, disturbs or hinders any

3

school activity, or hinders or obstructs any school in the performance of the
school's activities, and a penalty clause is provided for. Cabinet has taken a
decision to make Grade R compulsory. The intention to increase the penalty
provision from six months to 12 months was to ensure that the penalty provision
should serve as a deterrent for any person who interrupts school activity. The
amendment is necessitated by incidents, in several provinces, in which
communities, or portions of communities, prevented learners from attending
school in an attempt at making a political or other point. Service delivery protest
in Limpopo (Vuwani) has impacted on the provision of basic education because
some of the school infrastructure such as building were put on fire.

 Challenges in regard to learners’ access to quality basic education, as some
schools deny admission to some learners.

The amendments made provides that the SGB must submit the language and
admission policies of a public school, and any amendment thereof, to the HoD
for approval. The HoD may approve the policies, or any amendment thereof, or
he or she may return it to the SGB with recommendations, together with
reasons for such recommendations. The Ermelo judgement serve as a classical
example for the proposed amendment.

These amendments have become necessary as a result of confusion created
by sections 5(5) and 5(7) in regard to where the locus of authority lies in respect
of admission to public schools, and as to who has the final say on admissions.
When exercising the authority to admit learners, the HoD is not rigidly bound by
a school’s admission policy. The general position is that admission policies
must be applied in a flexible manner and that the right of a learner to be
admitted to a school takes precedence over the right of a school to enforce the
criteria set out in its admission policy.

Furthermore, the admission policy of the DBE provides that the admission
policy of a school must be consistent with the DBE's policy. Therefore, the HoD
must have an opportunity to study the admission policy of a school to ensure
that it is in fact consistent with the national policy.

 Challenges pertaining to procurement of Learning and Teaching Support
Material
Amendment of section 21 of the SASA to empower the HoD to centrally
procure identified learning support material for public schools, in consultation
with the SGB and on the basis of efficient, effective and economic utilisation
of public funds or uniform norms and standards.

 Uncertainty pertaining to home education legislation and monitoring of this
sector of education
The amendment (read with the amendments to section 3 of the SASA) makes
it clear that learners may be educated at home only if they are registered for
such education. A parent must, at the end of each of the three school phases,

4

notify the HoD if he or she intends to continue educating the learner at home.
The criteria that the HoD must consider when deciding whether or not to
approve an application are also set out. The amendment provides that the HoD
may, when considering an application, require a delegated official to conduct a
pre-registration site visit and consultation with the parents and learner to verify
the information supplied in the application documentation and to provide
support, where necessary, with the application process. It also sets out the main
responsibilities of a parent who wishes to educate his or her child at home.The
amendment proposes steps to protect parents who want to educate their
children at home in the Further Education and Training Phase (grades 10 – 12)
and will ensure that the final qualification obtained will give the learner
opportunities for further study at institutions of higher education.

1.2. What are the main root causes of the problem identified above?

What socio-economic problem
does the proposal aim to
resolve
What are the main roots or causes of
the problem
1.2.1 Deteriorating learner school
performance


1. Parents preventing learners from
attending school without just
cause

Learners are prevented from attending
school and from learning, in most
instances by their parents in cases
where the parent of a learner, without
just cause, fails to ensure that a
learner who is subject to compulsory
school attendance attends school, or
where any other person,
(communities, or portions of
communities, who wants to make a
political or other point) without just
cause, prevents such a learner from
attending school.
Service delivery protest in Limpopo
(Vuwani case) has impacted on the
provision of basic education because
some of the school infrastructure such
as building were put on fire and this
interrupted schooling.

2. Legislative environment: current
penalties are too lenient

This is as a result of the lenient current
penalty for preventing a learner from
attending school.

5

The existing penalty provision
imposes an imprisonment period of six
months which does not serve as a
deterrent to persons interrupting the
schooling of a learner.

3. Schools takes harsh disciplinary
action against learners for petty
offences such as hairstyles and
dress codes resulting in learner
drops and/or learner
emotional/mental distress

Schools take disciplinary action
against learners who do not adhere to
the schools’ codes of conduct in
regard to, for instance, hairstyles and
dress. Learners suffer mental anguish,
stay away from school and even drop
out of school.

The codes of conduct of public schools
do not take into account the diverse
cultural beliefs and religious
observances of learners. Ermelo
judgement is a classic example.The
schools are not sufficiently aware of,
or ignore, constitutional guarantees
and the needs of diverse cultures.

4. Class disruptions due to learner
intoxication

Learners have increasingly been
found in possession of, or abusing,
liquor and performance-enhancing
substances inside school premises
and in some instances, have led to
disruption of classes. The existing
section 8A of the SASA does not
address ill-discipline amongst learners

The Act does not prohibit liquor and
prohibited substances on school
premises.

In some cases, learners or other
persons are injured or incur damages
because schools do not comply with
the provisions of the Act, and state

6

funds are wasted as a result. Section
60 of the South African Schools Act,
1996,The law is not clear enough in
regard to the liability of the State for
any delictual or contractual damages
caused as a result of any school
activity conducted by a public school
for which the public school would have
been liable.

5. Institutional capacities/
systems/mechanisms: schools do
not have or do not effectively
implement protocols or
mechanisms during school
activities

Schools’ administration and
governance are disrupted when two or
more schools are merged. There are
no sufficient administrative and
transitional arrangements for such
mergers.

When a school has no learners, or has
too few learners to continue being
viable, communities suffer uncertainty
– amongst others, about how their
children will be transported to the
alternate school that has been
identified for those learners.

The procedure for the closing of
schools that have no learners or that
have too few learners to continue
being viable is onerous, and not
enough provision is made for giving
feedback to the communities involved.
The existing section 12A of the SASA
does not provide for a smooth and
clear provision for the process to
merge schools.

6. Curriculum and Assessment

There are challenges in regard to
formulating the national curriculum
statement and the procedures for the
assessment of learner achievement.
The Act does not empower the

7

Minister to appoint a group of experts
of persons to advise her on matters
pertaining to curriculum and
assessment.

7. District Staffing

The law does not empower the
Minister to make regulations on norms
and standards for district staffing.

The current section 61 of the SASA
does not empower the Minister to
make regulation on district staffing.

8. Procurement of LTSM

Learners do not receive sufficient
amounts of the correct quality of
learner support material, and money is
wasted by the current procurement
processes. Some schools purchase
some of their learner support material
in inefficient ways that waste money.
Governing bodies are not better
positioned to procure LTSM.

9. Regulations

The absence of regulations that are
enforceable in a court of law, and of
offences in regard to certain actions
that schools take, leads to
discrimination against learners on a
variety of grounds. Sections 61 of the
SASA does not empower the Minister
does not have the power to make
regulations on –
o the management of learner
pregnancy;
o minimum norms and standards
for provincial educator
development institutes and
district educator development
centres; and
o  a national education
information system.



8

1.2.2 Challenges in regard to
learners’ access to quality
basic education, as some
schools deny learners
admission

1. The Admission policy of public
schools
The criteria set out in a schools
admission policies must be flexible
to allow for admission of learners
with different backgrounds and
races. No admission policy must
favour a certain race or group of
learners.

2. The Language policy of public
schools

Schools need to adopt more than one
language of instruction in their
language policies where it is
practicable to do so in order to cater for
the language needs, in general, of the
broader community in the education
district in which the public school is
located.
The absence of checks and balances
by the Head of Department in respect
to admission and language policy
determined by the governing body
allows for a situation where these
policies are contrary to the constitution
and other education legislation
The current section 5 and 6 of the
SASA does not provide clear guidance
on the role of the HOD in respect to
admission and language policies.
The absence of regulations that are
enforceable in a court of law, and of
offences in regard to certain actions
that schools take, leads to
discrimination against learners on a
variety of grounds. The Minister does
not have the power to make regulations
on the admission of learners to public
schools
1.2.3 Uncertainty pertaining to
Home Education
legislation
1. Home education

The current provision on the
registration of home education
learners is subject to different
interpretation. The proposed provision

9

wish to strengthen this gap. Parents
must now register their children for
home education and have tutors
provide assessment reports to the
department on a quarterly basis.
Section 51 does not make provision for
competent assessors and provision of
learner assessment reports.

1.2.4 Challenges in regard to
organisational efficiency
and school governance
1. Governance in schools

In some cases, SGBs do not perform
all their functions properly, which
hampers the provision of education to
learners.

Corruption among SGB members in
regard to the procurement of goods
and services wastes money and
hampers the provision of education to
learners.

In some cases, governing body
members are remunerated for the
performance of their duties, which
means that money that should have
been spent on education is lost.

In some cases, there is a conflict of
interest in that the chairperson of the
governing body’s finance committee is
also an employee of the school. This
leads to poor governance, which
hampers the provision of education to
learners.

Unwise spending by governing bodies
– amongst others, by entering into
exorbitant lease agreements – wastes
a lot of money that should have been
put to good use in the education
system.

In some cases, the governing body
deviates substantially from the budget
approved by the parents. Such a
deviation may lead to poor and unfair
governance, which ultimately hampers
the provision of education to learners.
The law does not currently make it
compulsory for the governing body to

10

submit a substantial deviation from the
budget to the parents for
consideration.

In some cases, schools’ finances are
not properly managed and audited.
This leads to the loss of money that
should have been used for education.

It is not clear whether the subsidies
provided to independent schools are
properly managed and audited. If they
are not, it has a negative impact on the
provision of education to learners. It
also leads to a lack of transparent
accounting.

The law does not stipulate that
governing bodies are responsible for
submitting quarterly reports on all
income and expenditure of the school.
Also, currently, the law does not give
the HoD enough options for having the
financial matters of a school
investigated after, for example,
receiving allegations of corruption,
fraud or other improper use of school
money.

2. Dispute resolution (new insertion)

Disputes between governing bodies
and HoDs lead to the spending of
money on court cases instead of on
education, and this impacts negatively
on the provision of education to
learners. The law does not make
provision for dispute resolution
mechanisms.

The Rivonia matter is a classic
example where the court provided
clarity on the role of the governing
body and that of the HOD in relation to
admission of learners in schools

1.3. Summarise the aims of the proposal and how it will address the problem in
no more than five sentences.
The Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill seek to enhance the organisational
efficiency to improve school governance, leadership and accountability,

11

transforming education services and protecting vulnerable groups to ensure
learner well-being and access to learning.

1.4. How is this proposal contributing to the following national priorities?

National Priority Impact
1. Economic transformation and job
creation
Additional employment opportunities for
Grade R educators which also impacts on
their condition of service. It further creates
employment opportunities for competent
assessors for home education learners.
2. Education, skills and health

1.5. Please describe how the problem identified could be addressed if this
proposal is not adopted. At least one of the options should involve no legal or
policy changes, but rather rely on changes in existing programmes or
resource allocation.

Option 1. None, The status quo remains and this will be the
consequences-
 Infringement of learners’ Constitutional right to quality
basic education, negatively impacting on learner
performance.
 Challenges in regard to organisational efficiency and
school governance

12

 Uncertainty pertaining to Home Education
 Challenges in regard to learners’ access to quality
basic education, as some schools deny learners
admission
 Deteriorating learner school performance

2.2. Proposals inevitably seek to change behaviour in order to achieve a desired
outcome. Describe (a) the behaviour that must be changed, and (b) the main
mechanisms to bring about those changes. These mechanisms may include
modifications in decision-making systems; changes in procedures; educational
work; sanctions; and/or incentives.
a) What and whose behaviour does the proposal seek to change? How does
the behaviour contribute to the socio-economic problem addressed?
School:
They do not apply the legislation diligently enough and in some cases
act contrary to the legislation. Most of the schools use their admission,
language policies and code of conduct to discriminate certain sections
of learners’. Classical example is the wearing of dreadlocks which in
some cases learners wear them on cultural or religious grounds. The
consequences of this behaviour lead to challenges in regard to
learners’ access to quality basic education, as some schools deny
learners admission. To change the behaviour all admission, language
policies developed by governing bodies has to be approved by the
HOD

Unions involved in education:

In some cases, unions unnecessarily and unlawfully disrupt the
functioning of provincial education departments and/or school activities
to draw attention to their grievances. current penalties are too lenient

15

for persons interrupting access to basic education. Increasing the
penalty provision would serve as a deterrent to such behaviour.
Labour activities must respect the learners right to education.
Compliance with law is encouraged and instilled.
Parents:
In some instances, learners who are educated at home instead of at a
school face challenges especially when they reach grades 10, 11 and
12. Parents who educate learners at home chooses not to register their
learners for home education. The law is not clear on this relatively new
form of education in South Africa and on the responsibilities of parents
who choose to educate their children at home. Registration for learners
to receive education at home should be approved by the HOD to
address this behaviour. Home educators are encouraged to provide
education that is not inferior to education provided by the state.
SGBs:
They do not apply the legislation diligently enough and in some cases
act contrary to the legislation. Learners do not receive sufficient
amounts of the correct quality of learner support material, and money
is wasted by the current procurement processes. Procurement of
LTSM by governing bodies must comply with Constitution and the
PFMA. To address this behaviour the HOD will procure LTSM for
schools in consultation with governing bodies. Compliance with the
law is instilled on governing bodies.

Communities:
Communities have to be educated about their responsibilities. Service
delivery protest in some of the provinces interfere with school activities
and access to basic education is as a result denied. To address the
behaviour the Bill creates a new penalty provision and a harsher
sanction for anyone who prevents learners from attending school.

b) How does the proposal aim to bring about the desired behavioural change?

Deteriorating learner school performance and prevention of access to quality
basic education:

The desired change is to improve the learner performance and access
to quality basic education.
The Bill seeks to amend section 3(1) of the SASA to provide that
school attendance is compulsory from grade R and no longer only from
grade 1; and to increase the penalty provision in section 3(6) of the
SASA from six months to 12 months in the case where the parent of a

16

learner, without just cause, fails to ensure that a learner who is subject
to compulsory school attendance attends school, or where any other
person, without just cause, prevents such a learner from attending
school. The clause also creates an offence in the case where any
person unlawfully and intentionally interrupts, disturbs or hinders any
school activity, or hinders or obstructs any school in the performance
of the school's activities, and a penalty clause is provided for.

Challenges in regard to organisational efficiency and school governance:

The desired change is to bring about economies of scale. Amendment
of section 21 of the SASA to empower the HoD in consultation with the
governing body to centrally procure identified learning support material
for public schools, in consultation with the SGB and on the basis of
efficient, effective and economic utilisation of public funds or uniform
norms and standards

Challenges in regard to learners’ access to quality basic education, as some
schools deny learners admission:

The desired change is to remedy discrimination against learners on a
variety of grounds. The amendments made provides that the SGB
must submit the language and admission policies of a public school,
and any amendment thereof, to the HoD for approval. The HoD may
approve the policies, or any amendment thereof, or he or she may
return it to the SGB with recommendations, together with reasons for
such recommendations
The general position is that admission and language policies must be
applied in a flexible manner and that the right of a learner to be
admitted to a school takes precedence over the right of a school to
enforce the criteria set out in its admission and language policies.

Uncertainty pertaining to Home education:

The desired change is to provide clarity in regard to home education.
The amendment (read with the amendments to section 3 of the SASA)
makes it clear that learners may be educated at home only if they are
registered for such education. The three phases for which learners
must be registered are set out, which clarifies that a learner needs to
be registered only once, and not every year and to notify the HoD as
per the three phases. The criteria that the HoD must consider when
deciding whether or not to approve an application are also set out.

Provincial Education Department:


17

They will have to improve their performance – amongst others, by
diligently and timeously scrutinising schools’ language and admission
policies; and by improving their processes in regard to the appointment
of educators.
School:
They will have to adhere to the new aspects of the legislation.
Unions involved in education:
The Bill creates a new offence and institutes a harsher sanction in the
case of anyone who prevents learners from attending school.
Parents:
Educating parents about their responsibilities
SGBs:
They will have to adhere to the new aspects of the legislation

b) Summarise and evaluate the main disagreements about the proposal arising
out of discussions with stakeholders and experts inside and outside of
government. Do not give details on each input, but rather group them into key
points, indicating the main areas of contestation and the strength of support
or opposition for each position

Schools and their governing bodies are dissatisfied about the curtailing of
their powers. They are worried mainly about the clauses in terms of which
some of the functions of SGBs are transferred to the HoD

Home educators and Home Education Organisations are dissatisfied about
the education department having greater oversight on what home education
learners are taught. There are also concerns over home visits by education
officials prior to home education status being approved.



2.4. Describe the groups that will benefit from the proposal, and the groups that will
face a cost. These groups could be described by their role in the economy or
in society. Note: NO law or regulation will benefit everyone equally so do not
claim that it will. Rather indicate which groups will be expected to bear some
cost as well as which will benefit. Please be as precise as possible in identifying
who will win and who will lose from your proposal. Think of the vulnerable
groups (disabled, youth women, SMME), but not limited to other groups.

2.5. Describe the costs and benefits of implementing the proposal to each of the
groups identified above, using the following chart. Please do not leave out any
of the groups mentioned, but you may add more groups if desirable. Quantify
the costs and benefits as far as possible and appropriate. Add more lines to
the chart if required.

Note: “Implementation costs” refer to the burden of setting up new systems or
other actions to comply with new legal requirements, for instance new
registration or reporting requirements or by initiating changed behaviour.
“Compliance costs” refers to on-going costs that may arise thereafter, for
instance providing annual reports or other administrative actions. The costs and
benefits from achieving the desired outcomes relate to whether the particular
group is expected to gain or lose from the solution of the problem.
For instance, when the UIF was extended to domestic workers:
 The implementation costs were that employers and the UIF had to set up
new systems to register domestic workers.
 The compliance costs were that employers had to pay regularly through the
defined systems, and the UIF had to register the payments.
 To understand the inherent costs requires understanding the problem being
resolved. In the case of UIF for domestic workers, the main problem is that
retrenchment by employers imposes costs on domestic workers and their
families and on the state. The costs and benefits from the desired outcome
are therefore: (a) domestic workers benefit from payments if they are
retrenched, but pay part of the cost through levies; (b) employers pay for
levies but benefit from greater social cohesion and reduced resistance to
retrenchment since workers have a cushion; and (c) the state benefits
because it does not have to pay itself for a safety net for retrenched workers
and their families.

a) Describe the main risks to the achievement of the desired outcomes of the
proposal and/or to national aims that could arise from implementation of the
proposal. Add more lines if required.
 Note: It is inevitable that change will always come with risks. Risks may arise
from (a) unanticipated costs; (b) opposition from stakeholders; and/or (c)
ineffective implementation co-ordination between state agencies. Please
consider each area of risk to identify potential challenges.
 Possible risk may arise for PED to appoint additional staff to peruse
the admission, language policies and monitoring home education.
  Reluctance on the part of key education stakeholders to accept some
of the proposed amendments.
 Registration and cost implications associated to home schooling.

b) Describe measures taken to manage the identified risks. Add more rows if
necessary.
Mitigation measures means interventions designed to reduce the likelihood
that the risk actually takes place.

non-state actors, or (c) between non-state actors? Please provide as
complete a list as possible. What dispute-resolution mechanisms are
expected to resolve the disputes? Please include all of the possible areas of
dispute identified above. Add more lines if required.
Note: Disputes arising from regulations and legislation represent a risk to both
government and non-state actors in terms of delays, capacity requirements
and expenses.  It is therefore important to anticipate the nature of disputes
and, where possible, identify fast and low-cost mechanisms to address them.

2.9 Monitoring and Evaluation

Note: Sound implementation of policy and legislation is due to seamless monitoring
and evaluation integration during the policy development phase. Policies and
legislation that are proficiently written yet unable to report on implementation
outcomes are often a result of the absence of an M&E framework at the policy and
legislative planning phase. It is therefore imperative to state what guides your
policy or legislation implementation monitoring.

33

2.9.1 Develop a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation Plan, in collaboration with
your departmental M&E unit which should include among others the
following:
2.9.1.1 Provide clear and measurable policy or legislative objectives
2.9.1.2 Provide a Theory of Change clearly describing the following
components:
- Impact: the organisational, community, social and systemic changes
that result from the policy or legislation;
- Outcomes: the specific changes in participants (i.e. beneficiaries)
behaviour, knowledge, skills, status and capacity;
- Outputs: the amount, type of degree of service(s) the policy or
legislation provides to its beneficiaries;
- Activities: the identified actions to be implemented
- Input: departmental resources used in order to achieve policy or
legislative goals i.e. personnel, time, funds, etc.
- External conditions: the current environment in which there’s an
aspiration to achieve impact. This includes the factors beyond control
of the policy or legislation (economic, political, social, cultural, etc.)
that will influence results and outcomes.
- Assumptions: the facts, state of affairs and situations that are
assumed and will be necessary considerations in achieving success
2.9.1.3 Provide a comprehensive Logical Framework (LogFrame) aligned
to the policy or legislative objectives and the Theory of Change. The
LogFrame should contain the following components:
- Results (Impact, Outcomes and Output)
- Activities and Input
- Indicators (A measure designed to assess the performance of an
intervention. It is a quantitative or qualitative factor or variable that
provides a simple and reliable means to measure achievement, to
reflect the changes connected to an intervention, or to help assess
the performance of a development actor)
- Baseline (the situation before the policy or legislation is implemented)
- Targets (a specified objective that indicates the number, timing and
location of that which is to be realised)
2.9.1.4 Provide an overview of the planned Evaluation, briefly describing
the following:
- Timeframe: when it the evaluation be conducted
- Type: What type of evaluation is planned (formative, implementation
or summative) – the selection of evaluation type is informed by the
policy owners objective (what it is you want to know about your policy
or legislation.
2.9.1.5 Provide a straightforward Communication Plan (Note: a common
assumption is that the target group will be aware of, and understand
how to comply with a policy or legislation come implementation.
However, increases in the complexity and volume of new or
amendment policy or legislation render this assumption false. Hence,
the need for a communication plan to guide information and
awareness campaigns to ensure that all stakeholders (including
beneficiaries) are informed.

PART THREE: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

1. Briefly summarise the proposal in terms of (a) the problem being addressed and
its main causes and (b) the measures proposed to resolve the problem.
(a) Challenges in regard to learners’ school performance and access to
quality basic education.
The Bill seeks to amend section 3(1) of the SASA to provide that school
attendance is compulsory from grade R and no longer only from grade 1;
and to increase the penalty provision in section 3(6) of the SASA from six
months to 12 months in the case where the parent of a learner, without just
cause, fails to ensure that a learner who is subject to compulsory school
attendance attends school, or where any other person, without just cause,
prevents such a learner from attending school.
(b) Challenges in regard to learners’ access to quality basic education, as
some schools deny admission to some learners.

35

The amendments made provides that the SGB must submit the language
and admission policies of a public school, and any amendment thereof, to
the HoD for approval. The HoD may approve the policies, or any
amendment thereof, or he or she may return it to the SGB with
recommendations, together with reasons for such recommendations. The
Ermelo judgement serve as a classical example for the proposed
amendment.
(c) Challenges pertaining to procurement of Learning and Teaching Support
Material
Amendment of section 21 of the SASA to empower the HoD to centrally
procure identified learning support material for public schools, in
consultation with the SGB and on the basis of efficient, effective and
economic utilisation of public funds or uniform norms and standards.
(d) Uncertainty pertaining to home education legislation and monitoring of
this sector of education
The amendment (read with the amendments to section 3 of the SASA)
makes it clear that learners may be educated at home only if they are
registered for such education. A parent must, at the end of each of the three
school phases, notify the HoD if he or she intends to continue educating the
learner at home.
